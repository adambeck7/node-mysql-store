Here's an exampe of what you can do as a 'customer'. Inquirer will list our available products and you can choose one to purchase. It will then ask how many you would like to purchase. If that quantity is available a messsage prints out the total cost of your purchase and the remaining inventory. If there is not enough quantity to fulfill your request it prints a message letting you know what our current inventory is.
